    <p>Our Design Studio is a workplace for Designers and Artisans. We engage in conceiving, designing and developing new products, ideas, and techniques. Facilities in our Design Studio include infrastructure for design to finished garment making. In addition, we have equipment best suited for design work and extending to work Bench (for hand embroidery). The space is for constant new thinking and development. We keep a regular library of fabrics, sequins, beads, threads, etc.</p>
    <p><span class="title">Mocks:</span> (the way we present new developments) Our specialty here at the design studio is to create mocks: block of fabric only consisting of various embellishments/ prints. The idea behind this is to show to clients the main feature (which in this case would be just the embellishment/print). This method is much rapid than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client likes the design based on the mocks, they order it and the resulting garment can be made as per their requirements or our designs as well.</p>
    <p><span class="title">Hand Work:</span> The equipment used for special hand work such as (beading, sequins, embroidery, and appliqu√©) is a wooden frame with mesh in the middle, which makes the handwork possible for the artisans. The fabric is first cut into a block and attached onto the wooden frame. With the use of special needles, the handwork is completed beautifully with a sense of individuality.</p>
    <p><span class="title">Print Development:</span> We do various types of placement prints on fabrics to enhance the overall look as most of our product is multi-layered. Motifs are first developed by sketching and then converted to the computer for developing the screen. The number of colors in a particular design equates the number of screens.</p>
    <p><span class="title">Dyeing, Washing:</span> We also have the capacity to experiment with ombre effects: tie and dye, dip dye. Dyeing can be done in the fabric stage or the garment stage. These methods include direct dyeing; stock dyeing; top dyeing; yarn dyeing; piece dyeing; solution pigmenting or dope dyeing; and garment dyeing. Ideas are ours, but work is out-sourced. A simple silhouette can also be exclusive through washes. The look and feel of the garment can be taken to new levels through washing techniques.</p>
    <p><span class="title">Pattern Making, Construction:</span> This is where our design background kicks in. We persistently research and develop new silhouettes according to the latest trends with our qualified pattern makers, tailors and supervisors. In order for the garment to look impeccable at the final stage, construction is a very important aspect. We pay attention to neatness through various seam finishes depending upon the fabric quality. Overall goal here is to provide a sample line/ items as full finished garments for the sales team to work on approaching seasons in market place.</p>
